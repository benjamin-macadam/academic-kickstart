I am a PhD candidate in the programming languages lab at the University of Calgary. My research interests mainly revolve around tangent categories and theri applications to differentiable programming and Lie theory.

* Differentiable programming generalizes neural networks by allowing you to take the derivative of computer programs. Tangent categories provide a natural setting for the categorical semantics of differentiable programming languages. I'm currently working on the monad/Lawvere theory correspondence for tangent categories.
* The equivalence of categories between Lie groups and Lie algebras lies at the core of Lie theory.  I am working to extend this result to Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids using involution algebroids.

I also organize the University of Categories Peripatetic Seminar, if you are interested in attending or giving a talk, please reach out!
