I am a PhD candidate in the programming languages lab at the University of Calgary. My research interests include enriched category theory, differential geometry, Lie theory and their applications to the foundations of differentiable programming languages. 

I also organize the University of Categories Peripatetic Seminar, if you are interested in attending or giving a talk, please reach out!
